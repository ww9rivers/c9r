Test 1: Testing l3.default_gateway() to make sure it gets the default gateway
        that is in the system "netstat -rn" command.

     >>> import subprocess
     >>> from c9r.net import l3
     >>> gw = l3.default_gateway()
     >>> gw != '' and gw != None
     True
     >>> routes = subprocess.check_output(['netstat', '-rn'])
     >>> gw in routes
     True
